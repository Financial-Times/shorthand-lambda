## Usage

##### Publishing with Shorthand

The publishing app is integrated with Shorthand. You can use the Shorthand 'publish' option to publish stories directly to our Amazon S3 bucket.

Once the content has been published to the S3 bucket it will be available on FT.com at: https://www.ft.com/paidpost/<<folder-name>>/index.html where <<folder-name>> is the name you will choose in step 4 below.

Note that the above URL is not a Vanity URL; the publishing app is  compatible with Vanity URLs. See the Vanity URLs section below.

###### Step-by-step guide

1. Log into Shorthand
2. Click 'Publish' (or 'Republish') in the top-nav
3. Select "FT-Shorthand-Shorthand-staging" option from the 'Server' drop-down
4. In the "path of the story" field you must enter 'paidpost/' followed by any name that you choose.


###### Vanity URLs

The publishing App works with the URL Management Tool for setting Vanity URLs for published content.
