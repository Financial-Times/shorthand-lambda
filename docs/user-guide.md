# Commercial Content Publishing App User Guide

## Usage

##### Publishing with Shorthand

The publishing app is integrated with Shorthand. You can use the Shorthand 'publish' option to publish stories directly to our Amazon S3 bucket.

Once the content has been published to the S3 bucket it will be available on FT.com at: https://www.ft.com/paidpost/FOLDER-NAME/index.html where FOLDER-NAME is the name you will choose in step 4 below.

Note that the above URL is not a Vanity URL; the publishing app is  compatible with Vanity URLs. See the Vanity URLs section below.

###### Step-by-step guide

1. Log into Shorthand
2. Click 'Publish' (or 'Republish') in the top-nav
3. Select "FT-Shorthand-Shorthand-staging" option from the 'Server' drop-down
4. In the "path of the story" field you must enter 'paidpost/' followed by any folder name that you choose.
5. The post will then be published on FT.com at ft.com/paidpost/FOLDER-NAME/index.html (where FOLDER-NAME is the name you used in step 4)



###### Vanity URLs

In order to get the a vanity URL you will need to use the url-management tool.
Vanity URLs can be used to change the format of the post's URL from
ft.com/paidpost/FOLDER-NAME/index.html to ft.com/paidpost/ANY-NAME-YOU-CHOOSE

The publishing App works with the URL Management Tool for setting Vanity URLs for published content.
